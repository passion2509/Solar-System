# 3D Solar System Project

A simple project to build a 3D representation of our solar system that runs in a web browser.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS:** For basic styling of the page elements.
*   **JavaScript:** For the core logic and interaction.
*   **Three.js:** A JavaScript library to simplify the creation of 3D graphics in the browser.

## Getting Started (Conceptual)

1.  **Set up a basic HTML file:** This will be the container for our 3D scene.
2.  **Include Three.js:** Download the library or link to a CDN.
3.  **Write JavaScript code:**
    *   Initialize a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer.
    *   Add lighting.
    *   Create 3D objects (spheres) for the Sun and planets.
    *   Position and animate the planets in orbit.

## Milestones

Here are three clear milestones to guide the development:

### Milestone 1: Basic Scene and the Sun

*   **Objective:** Set up the fundamental 3D environment and render the Sun.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Create an HTML page to host the 3D scene.
    2.  Initialize a Three.js scene, perspective camera, and WebGL renderer.
    3.  Add a point light or ambient light to illuminate the scene.
    4.  Create a sphere geometry for the Sun.
    5.  Apply a basic material (e.g., a yellow color) to the Sun.
    6.  Add the Sun to the scene.
    7.  Implement a basic render loop to display the scene.

### Milestone 2: Adding Planets and Basic Orbits

*   **Objective:** Incorporate a few key planets with distinct appearances and simple orbits.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Create sphere geometries for at least three planets (e.g., Earth, Mars, Jupiter).
    2.  Assign different sizes and basic materials/colors to each planet.
    3.  Position the planets at appropriate initial distances from the Sun.
    4.  Implement a simple circular orbit animation for each planet around the Sun.
        *   For simplicity, orbits can initially be in the same plane.
    5.  Ensure planets have different orbital speeds.

### Milestone 3: Basic Interactivity and Enhancements

*   **Objective:** Add basic user interaction and some visual refinements.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Implement camera controls (e.g., OrbitControls from Three.js) to allow the user to zoom, pan, and rotate the view.
    2.  (Optional) Add a simple texture to Earth (e.g., a basic blue/green map).
    3.  (Optional) Add a moon to Earth, orbiting the Earth.
    4.  (Optional) Add simple rings for Saturn if it's one of the chosen planets.
    5.  (Optional) Display planet names as text labels (can be simple HTML elements overlaid or 3D text).
